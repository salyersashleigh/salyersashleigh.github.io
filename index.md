## About Me

![Branching](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/branching.png)

> Hi everyone!
>
> My name is Ashleigh Salyers and I am a graduate student in the Master of Science in Business Analytics Program at W&M. In 2017, I graduated from James Madison University  with a double major in Justice Studies and Sociology. Currently, I am a Reporting Analyst on a Project Management team supporting a fast-paced Government client. In my role, I  enjoy managing data, developing documents/reports, and conducting high level analysis. I know that this program will assist me in accomplishing my career goals! In my free time, I enjoy running, yoga/meditation, and spending time with my Fianc√©, Paul, and cat, Apollo.
